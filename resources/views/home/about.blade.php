                                <p>Two common approaches to investment portfolio construction are bottom up investing
                                    and top-down investing. A bottom-up investing approach is essentially a
                                    stock-picking method where you focus on individual security selection rather than a
                                    portfolio’s allocation to various countries, company-sizes, security types or other
                                    characteristics.

                                    However, we prefer a top-down investing approach. This method emphasizes broader
                                    economic factors. </p>
